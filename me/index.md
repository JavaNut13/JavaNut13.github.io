I am studying Software Engineering, develop a lot in Java because I've done that for a while now - mainly Swing and Android stuff - sometimes I even get money for it. When I'm lazy Ruby (on Rails) or Python makes a nice change. I hope [Swift](http://developer.apple.com/swift) will make these all pointless.

I should put some things here later..
