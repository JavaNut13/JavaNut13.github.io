I make stuff and have opinions about things. Currently a student. Often too busy learning new languages to ever use any of them. What's cool now:

+ Swift
+ Elixir
+ Crystal
+ Clojure

What's always cool? Ruby. You can't beat some good-ol' Ruby.

Some of my code ends up on [GitHub](https://github.com/javanut13) if I finish anything.

If you're curious about the tools I use, check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/javanut13/dotfiles) they are a good indicator for what I'm using (most likely Vim) and what languages I'm using (the most recently added syntax files/ plugins).

My profile picture was illustrated by my wonderful girlfriend, [Sarang](https://twitter.com/sarangleehan).
