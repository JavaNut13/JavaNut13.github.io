I'm Will Richardson, a software engineering student that occasionally makes apps and websites.

Currently my development is usually in Ruby on Rails or Android, depending on what I'm doing. I have been known to do both at the same time, occasionally. When I'm just whipping something up quickly I usually turn to Python because it's super easy to get something going quickly with minimal effort required. Sometimes I decide that Go is the language to use, I don't know why.

I started programming in Java before I had a username for anything on the internet - and so the username that stuck came from the bad old days of writing gnarly Swing desktop apps. So to this day I am known on the internet as _JavaNut13_.

In 2008 I started using Ubuntu as my OS of choice and completely got sucked into linux, especially the power of BASH over the Windows command line. It was in 2011 that I bought a Macbook out of spite and got completely hooked on the power of a unix-based OS with none of the pain that came with running Ubuntu.

When I'm not developing I practice Aikido - a martial art that focusses self defence by using your opponent's strength against them. In 2013 I gained the rank of _Shodan_.
