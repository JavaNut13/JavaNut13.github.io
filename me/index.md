Kiwi software engineer with too many silly ideas and not enough patience to finish any of them. Working as an [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/) at Google. Learnt some things doing a BE (Hons) in Software Engineering at the University of Canterbury, graduated in 2017. On a quest to find a programming language that makes software development easy, fast, and reliable, but deep down knows that this won't ever happen.

You can find my less well-formed opinions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willhbr) or my many half-started projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/willhbr). I seem to have an obsession with writing Lisp interpreters and compilers.

On the occasion that I venture outside, I do so to run, orienteer, or practice Aikido.
